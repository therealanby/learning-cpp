# learning-cpp
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_c9BZzLwBRJVJsIfe97ey45V4LP_HXiG &lt;- using this playlist to learn c++ and posting code here.

I will be referring some concepts to other languages that I have experience with like Java and Python. 

Stopped trying at vid 77. All notes after 77 are either missing some stuff or badly made. 

stuff I noticed:
- when using vscode editor and using terminal to compile and run, remember to save
- when you compile, you get an exe file. If you try to run it, and it gives an error about access denied or something and it disappears, it probably has something to do with your antivirus deleting "unsafe" files.

Intro to IO Streams
- typing = input stream
- the program output = output stream

- plumber terms : streams, flushing stream...

- a stream can be imagined as a tunnel
- typing creates individual characters flowing through that tunnel in sequence
- the tunnel deposits the data into a buffer
- the buffer will send data to the program
- the program does not get each character one at a time, it get sent chunks of it from the buffer
- for example, when typing to console as input, the buffer will not send the data until you press enter

- this works with files

- cin from istream for console input
- input from ifstream for file input

- cout from ostream for console output
- output from ofstream for file output

-i assume iostream combines both istream and ostream
- iofstream i assume is the same except for files

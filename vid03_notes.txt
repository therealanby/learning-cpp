#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	return 0;
}

- main() function runs the code
- return 0 tells the computere that execution was a success
- iostream imports functions (std::cout(c out)
- int main() just means that the main() function returns a function
- you can remove return 0 eventually
- << "hello world" will put that into std::cout

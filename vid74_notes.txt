Makefiles

- automate build process
- main idea: only recompile the changed stuff instead of everything and put everything back together

- you can compile directly into .exe or first compile to .o files which can also be compiled into .exe

- if you change file1, you can just compile that into a .o and link that back with the other .o files
- this method requires less work

- a makefile automates this
- make in terminal

- makefile is a text file
- file1.o:file1.cpp (means that if file1.cpp changes, .o also has to change) 
g++ -c file1.cpp

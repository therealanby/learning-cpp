intro to functions
- main() function
- main() is always called when c++ program starts
- a function structure:

[identifier]([optional arg],[another optional arg]){}

- a function call structure:

[identifier]([arguements]); 

- arguements are the input to a function and a value can be optionally returned(as stated by the function). when the function does something other than return that modifies something, that's called a side-effect

- when a function returns a value, you will want to store it in a variable

Pass by value/reference

void do_stuff(int x){

	//x is passed as a copy.
	//if the copy is modified, the original stays the same
	//this is pass by value
}

- mostly everything in c++ is pass by value (exception is an array)
- array is passed by pointer/reference. The pointer points to the actual location of the array and that array is the original(not a copy). If its values are changed, the original values will change too
- a pointer points to a location
- * is the symbol for pass by pointer

- passing by reference is similar to passing by pointer
- reference is manually done

-refence means that the variable refers to the same area of memory
- & is the symbol for pass by reference
(int &x) to represent pass by reference

Operator Overloading Intro

- variable operator + (variable name1, varibale name2){
	...
	return variable
	}
- works like a method/function
- use the "this"(you can actually choose not to include it) keyword to access preceding operand. succeding operators are kept in the parameter
- defined in a scope(usually a class)

vid94 - insertion and extraction operator
- you can also overload the >> and << used by cout and cin

- return ostream/istream& (need to be a reference)
- in the parameters: (std::ostream&[or istream&] output, Object obj)

- body {
	output << "stuff"
	return output
}

-basically, store stuff in the output stream and return it to be used. 
- this makes it so you don't have to repitively call method calls

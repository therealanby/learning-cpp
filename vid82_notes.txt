Intro to Structs

Structs vs Classes
- access modifiers: (public, private, protected)
	- public is visible by everything
	- private is visible only by class
	- protected ??? (I assume subclasses?)
- structs are default to public/classes are private by default
- can be changed: 
	private: ...
- struct and class are similar basically
- structs are only used to contain data members(no methods). called POD

- both are used to create objects

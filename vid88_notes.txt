Constructors & Destructors

- this->[class_variable_name] = [value];
- or you can do this 
- [class_variable_name] = [value];
- If default constructor exist: User me; //you can exclude "()"

Destructors:

~[classname](){ //takes no arguements
//code
}

- a destructor is called when an object is destroyed
	- function ends
	- program ends
	- local variable ends
	- delete operator is called

example:

	User u = new User;
	delete u;

Custom functions
- basically a set of instructions that you want to be able to call without having to write the set of code over and over again each time
__
int main() <--these parantheses is where the fucntion can take inputs
{
	return 0; <--return value
}

() - arguements go in the parameters
__
int multiple(int x, int x)
{
	return x*y;
}

1. function definition
2. function call
3. function declaration

- you are required to declare but luckily, the definition also serves as a declaration
- similar to nim. you have to define the function before using it. so a function can't use another function that is declared after it. 
- probably a good idea to define all the functions before the main() function
- c++ concept: multi-file programs will have a header file to declare all the functions while another file will contain the declaration

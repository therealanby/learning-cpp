Loops
- repeated stuff/code

ICU
- initialize variable (variable to track progress)
- condition (when to stop, using a variable as reference)
- update (manlipulate variable)

int i = 0; //I
while(i<10){ //C
	//code
	i++; //U
}


for(int i=0;i<10;i++){

}//like while loop except more organized and the I variable is scoped to the loop(will disappear after loop is done)

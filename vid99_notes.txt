Polymorphism
Teacher teacher;
User& u = teacher;

- teacher is referred to as a user 
- Use: treat different subclass as the same thing but each one can call a same method that does different things base on the subclass definition 


Other Notes:
- note: there are no interfaces in c++ but you can use a classes to simulate that
- nested classes are allowed
- structs can inherit from classes
- nested structs in classes
- ... more combinations of nesting and inheritance
- c++ allows multi-inheritance(meaning one class can inherit more than one class)
- diamond problem(method conflict between two inherited classes)
	- use virtual keyword
	- virtual means that the subclass has to redefine the method
	- no friend or static keyword
	- constructor not allowed, destructor allowed

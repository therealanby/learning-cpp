STL Array

- templatized array
- std::array<int,5>
- statically sized
- remember their length(.size())
- arrays are passed as pointers, vectors are passed as copies
- STL arrays are copied
- like an array and vector
- good when you know the size but don't want to work with an array
- STL array is an array wrapped by an object (this allows it to have useful methods provided by the object wrapper)

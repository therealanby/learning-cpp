Operator Overloading Intro

- variable operator + (variable name1, varibale name2){
	...
	return variable
	}
- works like a method/function
- use the "this"(you can actually choose not to include it) keyword to access preceding operand. succeding operators are kept in the parameter
- defined in a scope(usually a class)

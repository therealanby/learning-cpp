Four types of functions
- function
- method
- static method
- constructor

Function
- Like a method but stands alone 
 
Method
- Like a function but is tied to a class
- accessed through an object
- Object object = new Object; object.do_method()
- attached to object
- refers to specific object

Static Method
- A method but can be accessed through both the class and an object of that class
- attached to class
- doesn't refer to a specific object but probably to the class or all objects as a whole


Constructor
- a method to create a class
- it is called when instantiating a class
- ctor
- no return type in name and it doesn't return anything
- so instead of "int main", it'll be just "main" 
- no void or types, just the name


- Most of this is similar to java. The exception is the function which is not tied to a class. In Java, mostly everything is defined in a class

Intro to Multifile Compilation
- hard to compile multifile when compared to Java

Minimum
- 1) header file
- 2) implementation file
- 3) file that uses 1 and 2 (i guess you can call this the main file)

.h is the header, .cpp is the implementation
you can include them by stating: #include "name.h" which will look in the directory for the file

- if you are creating a function library, you can exclude 3
- if you are creating an executable, you have to include 3 to run everything

1 - declaration
2 - definition
3 - calling

#ifndef [CLASS_NAME]
#define [CLASS_NAME]
#enddef

- **this is for g++**

multi-file -> g++ file1.cpp file2.cpp

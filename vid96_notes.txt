- make the two cpp files(the main and one(or more) definition files) include the header file: #include "file.h"

- to avoid multi-declaration include this in header file:
#ifndef [random name]
#define [same random name]


... code

#endif (at the end)

- basically, if not defined, define... end if

Multifile Class

Declaration file:
- remove variables 
- remove access modifiers
- prefix the names of all functions (even constructor and destructor with class name ->  User::get_user(){...}
- the class name has to be the same as the class name in the header

Initialization file(header):
- only include initialization for methods 
- variables allowed
- access mod allowed
- class structure allowed
